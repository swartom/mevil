#+title: MEVIL: Minimal Edge Vertex Instruction Language


[[./mevil_logo.svg]]

This is the compiler for the Minimal Edge Vertex Instruction Language (MEVIL),

MEVIL (MEH-vehl) is a domain specific reduced-power graph instruction language, a domain specific language for creating random graph generators. In short a MEVIL program describes how a random graph should be generated.

The v.1 of the compiler is being written in go. The purpose of the language is to act as a reproducibility and audit intermediary for random graph projects that involve Lindenmayer Systems.

* The TODO list
- initial language definition + parser
